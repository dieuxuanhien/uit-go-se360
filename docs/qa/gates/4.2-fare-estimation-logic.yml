gate: PASS
rationale: |
  Comprehensive implementation with excellent test coverage (100%) and proper architectural patterns.
  All acceptance criteria met with robust edge case handling.

  **Strengths:**
  - 100% test coverage on core business logic
  - Proper monetary value handling (integer cents)
  - Configuration validation with Joi
  - Clean NestJS patterns and dependency injection
  - Comprehensive documentation

  **Minor Concerns (Non-blocking):**
  - No input validation for coordinate ranges or negative distances
  - Floating-point arithmetic in fare calculation (mitigated by rounding)
  - Test expects 7-8km for HCMC distance vs story's 8.5km estimate

  **Recommendations:**
  - Add input validation for robustness
  - Consider using BigInt or decimal libraries for financial calculations in production
  - Update story distance estimate to match actual calculation (~7.5km)
