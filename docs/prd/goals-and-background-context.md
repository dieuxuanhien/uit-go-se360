# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Build a cloud-native, scalable ride-hailing platform backend that demonstrates T-shaped engineering skills
- Implement a functional microservices foundation (UserService, TripService, DriverService) with proper service isolation
- Deploy infrastructure to AWS using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) with containerized services
- Create a portfolio-defining project that showcases real-world system engineering capabilities
- Master trade-offs between cost, performance, and complexity in distributed systems
- Complete one specialization module demonstrating deep expertise in a specific technical domain

## Background Context

UIT-Go is a fictional ride-hailing platform designed as the SE360 course capstone project to simulate real-world system engineering challenges. The project addresses the gap between academic learning and industry requirements by requiring students to build, deploy, and operate a cloud-native distributed system rather than just writing code.

The platform enables passengers to request rides and connect with nearby drivers through a microservices architecture. The project is structured in two phases: Phase 1 establishes the core "skeleton" microservices foundation (mandatory for all teams), while Phase 2 allows teams to specialize in one of five technical domains (Scalability, Reliability, Security, Observability, or FinOps/Automation), enabling students to develop T-shaped skills with both broad system knowledge and deep specialization.
