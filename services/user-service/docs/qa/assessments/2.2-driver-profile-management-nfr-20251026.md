# NFR Assessment: 2.2-driver-profile-management

Date: 2025-10-26
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: CONCERNS - Missing rate limiting
- Performance: CONCERNS - No performance verification
- Reliability: PASS - Proper error handling
- Maintainability: CONCERNS - Test coverage below target

## Critical Issues

1. **No rate limiting** (Security)
   - Risk: Brute force attacks possible
   - Fix: Add rate limiting middleware to auth endpoints

2. **Test coverage below target** (Maintainability)
   - Risk: Untested code paths
   - Fix: Add tests for uncovered branches and functions

## Quick Wins

- Add rate limiting: ~2 hours
- Increase test coverage: ~4 hours
- Add performance monitoring: ~1 hour
